    question: `What is a URL Shortener?`,
    answer: [
      `A URL shortener, also known as a link shortener, seems like a simple
    tool, but it is a service that can have a dramatic impact on your
    marketing efforts.`,
      `Link shorteners work by transforming any long URL
    into a shorter, more readable link. When a user clicks the shortened
    version, they’re automatically forwarded to the destination URL.`,
      `Think of a short URL as a more descriptive and memorable nickname for your long webpage address. You can, for example, use a short URL
    like bit.ly/CelebrateBitly so people will have a good idea about
    where your link will lead before they click it.`,
      `If you’re contributing content to the online world, you need a URL shortener.`,
      ` Make your URLs stand out with our easy to use free link shortener
    above.`,

    question: `Benefits of a Short URL`,
    answer: [
      `How many people can even remember a long web address, especially if
    it has tons of characters and symbols? A short URL can make your
    link more memorable. Not only does it allow people to easily recall
    and share your link with others, it can also dramatically improve
    traffic to your content.`,
      `On a more practical side, a short URL is
    also easier to incorporate into your collateral – whether you’re
    looking to engage with your customers offline or online.`,
      `Bitly is
    the best URL shortener for everyone, from influencers to small
    brands to large enterprises, who are looking for a simple way to
    create, track and manage their links.`,

    question: `What is a Custom URL Shortener?`,
    answer: [
      `A custom URL shortener, sometimes referred to as a branded URL
    shortener, lets you brand your links.`,
      `For example, instead of
    bit.ly/xyz, you could use a custom short URL like yourbrnd.co/xyz.`,
      `There are several benefits of branding your short links. Branded
    links build trust between your audience and your business, drive
    more clicks, give your audience a preview of where they are being
    taken and increase brand awareness.`,
      `A link shortening service that
    includes custom short URLs is vital to improving audience engagement
    with your communications. A short URL is good, but a custom URL
    works every time.`,

    question: `Features of Bitly’s Link Management Platform`,
    answer: [
      `If you’re looking to shorten just a link or two, our free URL
    shortener service will work for you.`,
      `But if you’re looking to share
    unique content in a way that feels personal to each user, you will
    need a link management platform. With our platform, you can brand
    your links with a custom domain, build QR codes, shorten links in
    bulk, redirect links, build campaigns and leverage many more
    features. If you need to create links at higher volumes, you can
    also take advantage of our powerful Bitly API.`,

    businesses, large enterprises: if you’re looking to grow and scale
    your brand or business – Bitly has a plan with the features you
